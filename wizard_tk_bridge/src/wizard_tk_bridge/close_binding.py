"""Bind the close-window key to a secondary window's close action.

On macOS the Tk toolkit does not close a window when the user presses
Cmd-W, so every secondary window binds that key here. Cmd-W is bound on
every platform, where it is harmless without a Command key, and Ctrl-W is
added on Windows, its customary close-window shortcut. The bound action
defaults to destroying the window but may be the window's own cancel or
abort handler, so the key behaves exactly like the window close button.
