"""A scroll command that shows a scrollbar only while it can scroll.

A table that fits its area needs no scrollbar, and a scrollbar that is
always shown wastes space and hints at hidden content that is not there.
:func:`auto_hide` returns the scroll command for a scrolling widget: the
command hides the scrollbar while the whole range is visible and shows it
again once the widget grows past its area. It works for any widget that
reports its position through an ``xscrollcommand`` or ``yscrollcommand``,
so a wizard table's canvas and any other scrolling widget can share it.
