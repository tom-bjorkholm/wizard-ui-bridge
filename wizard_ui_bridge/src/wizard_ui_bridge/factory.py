"""Factory selecting a text-mode user interface bridge.

The wizard talks to the user through a WizardUiBridge. This factory
returns a Textual full-screen bridge when Textual is installed and the
streams are a real terminal, and falls back to the console bridge
otherwise, such as when output is redirected, when running under tests,
or where Textual is not available. The fallback keeps the library
importable and usable even if Textual has been uninstalled.

Textual is an optional dependency, installed with the extra
`wizard-ui-bridge[textual]`. The Textual bridge is therefore imported
only when it is about to be used, and asking for it without Textual
installed raises ImportError instead of degrading silently.

This factory chooses between text-mode bridges only. An application with
a graphical user interface constructs a graphical bridge itself instead:
WizardUiBridgeTk from the companion package wizard-tk-bridge for Tkinter,
or a bridge of its own for another toolkit.
