"""User interface bridge for a wizard asking a user questions.

This module defines the abstract bridge between the wizard and a user
interface, the navigation requests a bridge raises to steer wizard flow,
and the column and cell descriptors used by table questions. Concrete
console and graphical bridges derive from WizardUiBridge.

An application that drives the wizard is responsible for implementing
the typed ask methods of its bridge, together with show(). A concrete
bridge implements ask_text(), ask_choice(), ask_multi(), ask_yes_no()
and ask_table(); ask_path() has a permanent base implementation that a
bridge may override for a native file or directory picker.

A GUI, textual, curses or web application should override ask_form() to show
the whole form at once, so the user sees every question together and answers
them in any order. The base implementation is permanent and suitable for a
console text interface.

A GUI, textual, curses or web application should also override ask_path() to
provide a native file or directory picker. The base implementation asks for
text and validates the path.
