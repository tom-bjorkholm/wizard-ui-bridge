"""Definitions of types for wizard UI bridge forms.

Wizard UI bridge forms are used when a number of questions should preferably
be asked on a single form (in a GUI, textual or curses implementation).
For a good user experience the user should see all questions at the same time,
and the user should be able to fill in the answers in any order, and change
them before submitting the form.

In a GUI, curses or textual implementation, the form is typically displayed
in a single window, in something like a grid layout, with 2 columns and
2 - 10 rows. The left column contains the questions, and the right column
contains the input fields. Above the grid there is typically a longer question
or instruction, that explains to the user what the form is about. Below the
grid there are typically buttons for submitting the form, canceling the form,
and possibly for going back to a previous form step in a multi-step wizard.

This file defines the data types used to describe the questions and answers of
a form, and the validation callback function that is used to validate the
answers of a partly filled form.

    """Result of validating a partly filled form.

    Attributes:
        is_valid: True when the form is valid, False when it is not valid.
        message: A message to be displayed to the user, explaining why the
                 form is not valid. Empty string when the form is valid.
        disable_row_idxs: A tuple of row indexes that should be disabled in the
                          form, because what has been filled in so far makes
                          these rows irrelevant. For example if ouput format
                          is set to some binary format, then the row(s) that
                          ask for character encoding can be disabled, because
                          they are irrelevant for the chosen output format.
                          Actually disabling these rows is not strictly
                          necessary, but it is a good user experience to do so.
        prefill_values: Values the validator asks the bridge to place into
                        other rows' inputs, as a tuple of (row_index, value)
                        pairs. Each value must match the answer type of the
                        field in that row. A bridge applies each request
                        during live editing as if the user had typed the
                        value; setting a value equal to the one already there
                        is a no-op, so a validator that emits a stable value
                        does not loop. The validator owns idempotency: it
                        should emit a prefill only when it means to fill or
                        overwrite the target. A prefill aimed at the row that
                        just changed is ignored, so writing back never fights
                        the user's current edit. A prefill aimed at a disabled
                        row is still applied, so the value shows in the greyed
                        row and takes effect if the row is later enabled. A
                        row index outside the form, or a value whose type does
                        not match the field, raises an exception, since both
                        are validator bugs. A choice or multi-choice value not
                        among the field's choices, and any prefill of a
                        sensitive field, are ignored. prefill_values is a
                        live-editing convenience only and is ignored when the
                        form is submitted, so an application must still apply
                        the same default on submit.
