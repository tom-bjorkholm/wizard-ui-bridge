    A user interface raises a subclass of this exception from an ask

    validation errors, so its retry loops never catch them and they

    A bridge raises this when the user chooses "back". The wizard
    restores the data collected before the previous question and asks
    that question again. Raised at the first question of one wizard call
    it has no earlier question within that call, so the wizard lets it
    propagate out to the application. The application can then step back
    in its own outer navigation, for instance to the previous section.

class WizardCancelLevel(WizardNavigation):

    A bridge raises this when the user asks to step out of the current
    level of questions, such as a table of detail values or a group of
    questions that exist only because of an earlier choice.
    Unlike WizardBack, which moves to the previous question at the same
    level, this asks to return to the question one level out whose answer
    opened the current level, so the user can change that answer. The
    answers collected at the current level are not recorded as answers,
    but a well crafted wizard keeps them in memory as drafts so that
    they can be offered as defaults if the user returns to the level and
    provided that answers to other questions have not invalidated them.

    Each level's driver catches this from the level it opened and re-asks
    the opening question. When the current level has no enclosing level,
    the outermost driver cannot step out; following this contract it
    re-asks the current question and tells the user there is no outer
    level. Nesting may be arbitrarily deep: each driver either handles the
    request for the level it opened or lets it propagate further out.
