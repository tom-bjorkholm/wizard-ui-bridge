"""Demonstrate WizardUiBridge.ask_form() with a small export form.

This teaching example is deliberately self-contained: it asks the user a
handful of related questions on one form and then prints a summary of the
answers. Nothing is written to disk, so the reader can focus entirely on
how ask_form() is used and not on the surrounding application logic.

Why ask_form() exists
---------------------
The other bridge questions (ask_text, ask_choice, ...) ask exactly one
thing at a time. That is natural on a plain console, but a graphical or
full-screen textual interface can do better: it can show several related
questions together so the user sees the whole picture and answers them in
any order before submitting. ask_form() is the bridge method for that. It
takes a description of the whole form (a list of Ask*Field objects) and
returns one Answer*Field per question.

The same call works on every bridge:

- On a graphical or textual bridge (here the Textual bridge chosen by
  make_text_ui_bridge() in a real terminal) the whole form is shown on one
  screen with a labelled input widget per field.
- On the plain console bridge the base implementation of ask_form() simply
  asks each field in turn with the ordinary typed ask methods, so the same
  program still runs when output is redirected or under tests.

Because make_text_ui_bridge() falls back to the console bridge whenever the
streams are not a real terminal, this example is both a nice full-screen
form in a terminal and a fully scriptable console program in tests.

    This validator shows both behaviours. The delimiter only matters for
    CSV, so for any other format its row is disabled (is_valid stays True).
