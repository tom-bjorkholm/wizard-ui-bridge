"""Demonstrate the typed form fields and validator prefills of ask_form().

This teaching example builds on e05_ask_form.py. Where e05 uses the six
original field kinds (text, integer, path, yes/no, single choice and
multi choice), this example shows the five typed fields added on top of
them, and it shows how a partial validator can *prefill* one field from
the answers to others.

The typed fields
----------------
Besides making the answer a real Python object instead of a string, the
typed fields let a graphical or textual bridge offer a better editor:

- AskFloatField      a number (here a ticket price),
- AskDateField       a calendar date (the Textual bridge opens a calendar
                     picker for it),
- AskTimeField       a wall-clock time,
- AskDateTimeField   a date together with a time (the calendar picker
                     fills the date part, the time is typed),
- AskDurationField   a length of time, written as ``<days> d HH:MM:SS`` or
                     as a plain number of seconds, which is friendlier than
                     forcing the user to enter one large second count.

On the plain console bridge each field is still asked as text and parsed,
so the very same program runs under tests and with redirected input. That
is why this example is fully scriptable even though it shows a calendar in
a real terminal.

Prefilling a field
------------------
The form has an "Ends at" date-time field that the user rarely wants to
compute by hand. The partial validator computes it from the event date,
the start time and the duration and returns it as a *prefill*: the bridge
places the value into the "Ends at" input exactly as if the user had
typed it, and the user is still free to change it afterwards. The same
validator also *disables* the ticket-price row when the event is marked
free, so the price question disappears while it is irrelevant.

Nothing is written to disk, so the reader can concentrate on ask_form().
