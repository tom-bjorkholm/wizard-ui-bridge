"""Implement a WizardUiBridge of your own for an unusual device.

This is the advanced capstone of the wizard-ui-bridge examples. The earlier
examples *used* a bridge that this package already provides; this one *is* a
bridge, written from scratch, so you can see exactly what it takes to teach
the wizard a new user interface.

The device: an uppercase-only teleprinter
-----------------------------------------
Imagine driving a classic uppercase-only teleprinter, such as a Teletype
Model 33. It can print capital letters A-Z, the digits 0-9 and a handful of
punctuation marks (``. , : - ( ) [ ] ?``) and nothing else: no lowercase, no
Unicode, no box drawing. Sending any other glyph does not merely look wrong,
it jams the machine.

The console bridge writes whatever text it is given straight to the stream,
so it cannot safely drive this device: the very first lowercase letter or
slash would jam it. So we need a bridge whose one distinctive job is to
*fold* every line it prints into the device's glyph set. That single
responsibility is the whole reason this bridge exists, and it is pure
standard library, so the example stays small.

Correctness first: the base class does most of the work
-------------------------------------------------------
A WizardUiBridge is designed so a new bridge is *correct from day one and
improved incrementally*. Only a handful of methods have no default and must
be implemented: the mandatory ask methods ``ask_text``, ``ask_yes_no``,
``ask_choice``, ``ask_multi`` and ``ask_table``, plus ``show``. Everything
else has a permanent base implementation this bridge simply inherits:

- ``ask_path`` asks for text through ``ask_text`` and validates the path,
- ``ask_int`` asks for text and re-asks until the value is a number in range,
- ``ask_form`` asks the form's fields one at a time with the typed ask
  methods above.

So the moment the mandatory methods work, this bridge can already run any of
the earlier wizards unchanged, path questions and whole forms included. This
example proves it by importing the export-settings wizard from
``e02_question_kinds`` and running that unchanged code through the new
bridge. A bridge works with *any* wizard; a wizard runs on *any* bridge.

One correctness gap is deliberately left open, not hidden: a table question
with both min_rows and max_rows asks for a *variable* number of rows, which
the user can only supply if the bridge lets them add and remove rows. That is
correctness, not polish -- a wizard that expects the user to extend a table
(a translation table, say) cannot receive those rows otherwise. Implementing
the add/remove interface is left out here only for brevity, so ask_table()
raises NotImplementedError for a variable-row request rather than silently
returning just the starting rows; WizardUiBridgeConsole and
WizardUiBridgeTextual show two ways to implement it.

User experience second: the "override to improve" move
------------------------------------------------------
The mandatory methods above are the *floor for correctness, not the target*.
A production bridge should override every method whose user experience its
environment can improve. To show the move concretely, this bridge overrides
exactly one convenience method, ``ask_int``: the base ``ask_int`` asks bare
and explains the allowed range only *after* a rejected value, which reads
badly on a teleprinter where that reason scrolls away. The override states
the range up front and then delegates the actual re-ask loop to
``super().ask_int`` -- better UX, no logic rewritten.

The UX ladder: what a real bridge should climb next
---------------------------------------------------
This bridge deliberately stops at the floor plus one rung, so the code stays
readable. A real bridge should keep climbing. Each rung below names the
capability it exploits and the built-in bridge that already shows how, so the
console and Textual bridges in this package are your two reference rungs:

1. Whole-screen ``ask_form`` -- show every field at once instead of one at a
   time. See ``WizardUiBridgeTextual.ask_form``.
2. A native ``ask_path`` picker -- a file/directory dialog instead of typed
   text. A GUI toolkit supplies one; the text bridges validate typed text.
3. A calendar for date fields -- see the date widgets in the Textual bridge.
4. Richer typed-field widgets (spin boxes, sliders) for the float, time and
   duration fields.
5. ``help_text`` as a tooltip rather than an extra printed line.
6. Inline re-ask -- show a rejected value's reason beside the field instead
   of scrolling it into the transcript.

The helper modules ``wizard_ui_bridge.bridge_helpers`` and
``wizard_ui_bridge.form_helpers`` exist to make climbing this ladder cheaper:
they interpret raw answers, run the table loop and validate form prefills
exactly as the built-in bridges do. This example already uses the
``bridge_helpers`` functions so the mandatory methods stay a few lines each.

Running it
----------
``--ui`` selects the bridge, and the very same wizard runs on all three, so
you can watch the folding appear only on the custom (teleprinter) bridge::

    python -m wizard_ui_example.e07_custom_bridge
    python -m wizard_ui_example.e07_custom_bridge --ui console
    python -m wizard_ui_example.e07_custom_bridge --ui textual
